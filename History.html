<!-- <p>The <abbr title="Hall Association Research and Project">HARP</abbr> Grant Program was born from a vision to place the power and locus of control into the hands of residents living and learning in Residence Halls. It started with a humble source of inspiration. Students in our residence halls began to express interest not only in attending events that were being organized by Hall Staff, but also showed initiative toward planning and running events themselves, albeit with some support and guidance from Hall Staff. In addition to recreational events and projects, some residents also expressed interest in pursuing technical and academic projects but then found that they did not have the resources to pursue these goals. Thus, the <abbr title="Hall Association Research and Project">HARP</abbr> Grant Program was developed to address this need demonstrated by students, with the belief that providing them with resources and opportunities will result in the enhancement of the experience and quality of life of students in the residence halls. We hope that this program will become an effective tool to enhance both the community students live in and their own sense of ability and growth.</p> -->
