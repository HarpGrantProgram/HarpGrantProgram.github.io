The mission of the <abbr title="">HAPR</abbr> Grant Program is to encourage students, particulary those just starting at a university, to collaborate and being to work on projects that are both interesting to them and beneficial to the community that they live in. 

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.
